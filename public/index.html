        <p class='lead'>Managing your investments is easier than you think. Learning this skill could save you thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.</p>

        <p>About 10 years ago my mom passed away. It was easily the toughest time in my entire life. I’d just graduated college 2 months before, and suddenly I was managing her estate while working full-time and commuting back to St. Pete to do repairs and sell my childhood home – all while trying (usually unsuccessfully) to collect money from a tenant living on her property. During this time I learned a <strong>lot</strong> about how to manage money – often by making mistakes.</p>


        <h2>A Realization</h2>
        <div class="aside-right"><p>This is a really cool feature of this</p></div>
        <p>I realized at the time that I knew next to nothing about investing, or how to manage money. How to budget and not go into debt is one thing, but knowing how to save and invest is a completely different learned skill. With many ways to approach this, it can be more than a little confusing.</p>

        <p>It’s also scary making a huge deposit of your hard earned cash into somewhere new – hoping that you’re making the right choice. After more than a decade of managing my own investments (with respectable returns), I wanted to share what I’d learned, but also open myself up for advice on what’s mostly been a process of personal-learning.</p>


        <h2>Educate Yourself</h2>

        <p>Sadly, some of the best education comes from trying things and learning, but there’s a lot that can be read beforehand. The goal is to get to a point where you can understand the terms you’ll see when investing. I always point people towards the same book – Bogleheads Guide to Investing. This isn’t a book about doing some hot investment method, but one about how to save and invest money for the long term while reducing taxes and riding things out when returns get rough.</p>
